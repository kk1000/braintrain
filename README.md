Its an android app wich is having basic arithmetical questions in the form of multiplication, addition, subtraction and factorials.
There is a time limit of 60seconds in which you have to do as much questions as you can.
There are 4 options to each question.
Each time you will select an answer both questions and answer will automatically change.
At last your score card will appear which will tell you the score you have got out of the number of questions you have attempted.
